## Learning Goals

  * Solidify and demonstrate your understanding of:
  * DRY JavaScript
  * localStorage to persist data
  * event delegation to handle similar event listeners
  * Understand the difference between the data model and how the data is displayed on the DOM
  * Iterate through/filter DOM elements using for loops
  * Use your problem solving process to break down large problems, solve things step by step, and trust yourself to not rely on an outside “answer” to a logical challenge

## Future Additions
* Choose-your-emoji functionality
* Play VS Computer / AI
* Scaling for mobile
